# Welcome to Style Guide

Style Guide is an opinionated configuration for both Prettier and ESLint.
It is a curated collection of common sense rules that are designed to help you write clean, consistent, and maintainable code.

The goal is to be zero-config. You can configure both Prettier and ESLint to use Style Guide with a single line of code each.

## Installation

All dependencies are included. There is no need to install or manage ESLint or Prettier.

```bash
npm i -D style-guide
```

```bash
yarn add -D style-guide
```

```bash
pnpm add -D style-guide
```

```bash
bun add -d style-guide
```
